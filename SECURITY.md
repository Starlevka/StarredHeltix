2. Include a detailed description of the vulnerability
3. Provide steps to reproduce the issue
4. If possible, include a fix or workaround

Please do NOT:

## Response Time

## Security Considerations

StarredHeltix is a Minecraft client-side mod that:
- Does not collect or transmit personal data
- Does not connect to external services except for Discord RPC (which is optional)
- Operates entirely within the game environment
- Does not modify game files or system settings

As a client-side mod, it has no server-side components that could pose security risks to multiplayer servers.
